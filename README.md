# AI Text Detector

A FastAPI-based application that detects whether text was written by a human or generated by AI using machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Text classification: Distinguishes between human-written and AI-generated text
- REST API: Simple interface for integration with other applications
- Confidence levels: Provides probability scores for predictions
- Fast and lightweight: Built with FastAPI for high performance

## Project Structure

```

├── backend/
│   ├── app.py                # FastAPI application
│   ├── model/
│   │   ├── detector.py       # ML model and text processing
│   │   └── trained_model.pkl # Saved model (generated on first run)
│   └── data/
│       ├── Human_written.txt # Training data for human text
│       └── Ai_written.txt    # Training data for AI text
└── requirements.txt          # Dependencies
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd detect
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare training data (optional):
   - Place human-written samples in `backend/data/Human_written.txt`
   - Place AI-generated samples in `backend/data/Ai_written.txt`

## Running the Application

Start the FastAPI server:

```
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload
```

The API will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000



### Endpoints

#### GET `/`
- Returns a simple status message
- Response: `{"message": "AI Text Detector API is running"}`

#### POST `/detect`
- Analyzes text to determine if it was written by AI
- Request body:
  ```json
  {
    "text": "Your text to analyze here"
  }
  ```
- Response:
  ```json
  {
    "is_ai": true/false,
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "classification": "AI-generated" or "Human-written"
  }
  ```

## How It Works

1. The system extracts features from text:
   - Word count
   - Sentence count
   - Average sentence length

2. These features are fed into a Logistic Regression classifier that has been trained on samples of both human-written and AI-generated text.

3. The model returns a classification (human/AI) and confidence score.

## Development

### Adding More Features

To improve model accuracy, you can modify the `extract_features` function in `detector.py` to include additional text characteristics like:

- Vocabulary diversity
- Punctuation patterns
- Part-of-speech distributions
- Sentence structure analysis
