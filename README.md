# AI Text Detector

![AI Detection](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI%20Detection-Enabled-brightgreen)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8+-blue)
![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flask-Latest-000000)

A machine learning application that identifies whether text was written by a human or generated by AI using a simple but effective classification model.

## ✨ Features

- **Text Classification**: Distinguishes between human-written and AI-generated text
- **Confidence Scores**: Provides probability estimates with each prediction
- **Flask API**: Simple interface for easy integration with websites and applications
- **Lightweight Design**: Minimal resource requirements for efficient operation

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd detect
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up training data:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p backend/data
   ```
   
   Then add your training samples:
   - Create `backend/data/Human_written.txt` with human-written text samples
   - Create `backend/data/Ai_written.txt` with AI-generated text samples

## 🖥️ Running the Application

Start the Flask server:

```bash
python backend/app.py
```

The application will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:5000

## 📝 API Usage

### API Endpoints

#### GET `/`
- Returns a status message confirming the API is running
- Response: `{"message": "AI Text Detector API is running"}`

#### POST `/detect`
- Analyzes text to determine if it was written by AI
- Request body:
  ```json
  {
    "text": "Your text to analyze here"
  }
  ```
- Response:
  ```json
  {
    "is_ai": true/false,
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "classification": "AI-generated" or "Human-written"
  }
  ```

### Example Usage

**Using curl:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:5000/detect" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text":"This is the text I want to analyze."}'
```

**Using Python requests:**
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "http://127.0.0.1:5000/detect",
    json={"text": "This is the text I want to analyze."}
)
print(response.json())
```

## 🧠 How It Works

The detection system analyzes text using these features:

1. **Text Feature Extraction**:
   - Word count
   - Sentence count
   - Average sentence length (words per sentence)

2. **Classification Process**:
   - Features are processed by a Logistic Regression model
   - Model compares patterns against known human/AI samples
   - Output includes classification label and confidence score

## 🔧 Improving the Model

You can enhance the model's accuracy by:

1. **Adding more features** to `extract_features()` in `detector.py`, such as:
   - Vocabulary diversity metrics
   - Punctuation usage patterns
   - Part-of-speech distribution analysis
   - Sentence complexity measures

2. **Expanding training data**:
   - Add more diverse examples of human writing
   - Include samples from different AI models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
   - Create domain-specific training samples
